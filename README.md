# Email Scraper

This script used to scrape the text from all the emails
in a Gmail account that is subscribed to various humanitarian
newsletters and charities.  The text is then parsed for the frequency of certain
search terms and then recorded in the accompanying Excel Workbook.  This tool
was used to analyze a large volume of emails to paint a picture of how certain
organizations use words that connote positive or negative emotions and direct
solicitations in their fundraising outreach.
